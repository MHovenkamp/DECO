## building the robot

The head:
The head consists of two parts: a roundish ball, the lower head and a dome for the face. 
1. Place the micro lidar and the oledscreen in the upper face and make sure that they are stuck using either a little bit of glue or some electricity tape.
2. place on of the servo motors in the g0 degree position, THsi can be done by connecting to the Arduino and running the return_to_start_pos command. Glue the neck horizontal to the servo motor making sure that there is a 90 degree angle between the motor and the neck.
3. place the servo with the neck part in the slot in the lower body and attach with some glue. 
4. Route all the cables for the components through the whole in the bottom of the lower body

The body:
1. Stick the servo through the bottom hole of the upper body. And turn the servo to 90 degrees. glue the vertical neck part to the servo with the attachment part diagonal to the servo. 
2. Attach the PIR sensor through the whole and attach with taper or glue. place the arduino in the bottom lower body and connect al the cables as shown in the Fritzing. 

Attachment
Connect the upper head to the lower head with some glue making sure the head looks up and down if the servo is moved. 
Slide the two neck pieces to each other attaching the robot together, make sure al the wires can get to the arduino with some space for movement. glue the lower and upper body together after connecting the usb cable into the arduino making sure the PIR sensor looks forward.

Voila! Robot.
