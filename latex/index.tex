This robot is a desk companion for peoplt with a desk job. The robot reminds the user to stay healthy and productive without being pushy. The robot reminds people to take breaks and drink enoug water. It can also inform the user of their current environment such as temperature.

THis is so the robot can be used by the previously mentioned minor from the HU.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{Necessary components to build this robot.}\label{index_autotoc_md3}
